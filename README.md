# beatrice-wheelhouse

Proposal for a half-wheelhouse for BEATRICE OF HULL.

BEATRICE's original wheelhouse is a collapsing design consisting of
removable wall panels and doors in iroko and a five-panel roof in
plywood and fibreglass.
The structure installs by hinges to an iroko plinth fixed to the
underlying steel hull.

The proposal includes a design for a replacement structure consisting
of fixed wall panels and a fixed roof which rest on the original
(slightly modified) iroko plinth.

The design retains the aesthetic of the original wheelhouse and adopts
much of its structural organisation.
The design supports the phased build of a replacement wheelhouse by
specifying a roof that will integrate with the existing timber walls.

The design proposal is being developed in
