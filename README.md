# beatrice-wheelhouse

Project to build a new half-wheelhouse for BEATRICE OF HULL.

BEATRICE's original wheelhouse is a collapsing design consisting of
removable wall panels and doors in iroko and a five-panel roof in
plywood and fibreglass.
The structure installs by hinges to an iroko plinth fixed to the
underlying steel hull.

This project proposes a design which retains the aesthetic of the
original wheelhouse and adopts much of its structural organisation.
In particular, the proposed design retains the iroko plinth of the
original wheelhouse and supports a phased build of a replacement
wheelhouse by specifying a roof that will integrate with the
original timber structure.

The design proposal is being developed as a 3D model in
[Autodesk Fusion](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal).

The

design.

## Overview

The wheelhouse roof and walls are considered separately: in particular, an implementation of the roof design will  en

1. Aluminium, fully glazed, isolated, fixed, half-wheelhouse.
2. Two half-split doors to port and starboard side decks.
3. Twin assymmetric doors to aft deck.
4. Double/triple glazing.
5. Electrical cabling in conduits embedded in roof perimeter.
